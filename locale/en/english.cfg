[item-description]
remnant-beacon=A beacon for space platforms that attracts used rockets. Makes the platform a priority for used rockets spawning. Reccomended that it only be placed on stationary platforms.\nMust be fully powered to have priority.
rocket-chunk=A piece of a used rocket. Can be reprocessed.

[mod-setting-description]
enable-incomplete-rocket-parts=Changes how rockets are constructed.\nMainly intended for balance, as you could just launch rockets and get infinite processing units and LDS without it.\nReccomended setting is enabled.
enable-incomplete-rocket-parts-productivity=Allows productivity for incomplete rocket parts. Could be extremely broken with highest tier modules.\nReccomended setting is disabled.
debug-mode=Enables logging of debug messages in chat.\nReccomended setting is disabled.

remnant-beacon=Remnant Beacon

[technology-description]
rocket-chunk-processing=Enables used rockets drifting around in orbit. Chunks can be reprocessed into rocket ingredients except fuel.
remnant-beacon=Remnant Beacons attract used rockets when placed on a platform. Makes used rockets prioritize spawning on platforms with a powered beacon.
